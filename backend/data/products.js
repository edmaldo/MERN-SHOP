    description:
      "Depicting Picasso's muse and lover Dora Maar, a painter and photographer in her own right, this work beguiles the viewer. Its abstracted imagery recalls the artist's seminal painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), a canvas that secured his place in art history. Femme assise is a half-length portrait showing Dora with her arms framing her body; in one arm she holds a piece of fruit.",

    description:
      "Joan Miró Oda a Joan Miró, 1973 stems from a collaborative project with poet Joan Brossa, who was a Catalan like Miró and a leading early figure in the visual poetry movement in the Spanish region. Miró and Brossa created the 'Oda à Joan Miró' series simultaneously, with Miró working on his suite of illustrations as Brossa made progress on the ode. Brossa formed his ode not with words but with visual poems in tissue and string, creating a highly original and beautiful 'text' that met Miró's art on its level of individuality.",

    description:
      "Henri Matisse Odalisque au coffret rouge (Odalisque with Red Box), 1952 is an exquisite study of an odalisque. Matisse visited Morocco in the early 1910’s and became fascinated with the exotic odalisques he encountered there. In this aquatint, a sparsely clad woman in brightly colored garb lounges on her couch. She looks relaxed, with all of her limbs soft and spread out. Matisse forms her body with sweeping, reverent brushstrokes, and delicately draws her facial features. Matisse fills the scene with more brilliant color, lining the wall behind the odalisque with bright greens and yellows, and darker blues.",

    image: "/images/picasso-skull.jpg",
    description:
      "Pablo Picasso's Nature morte au crane, c. 1960 is a beautifully vibrant color aquatint done after the artist's 1947 painting. The composition is Picasso's cubist take on a traditional still life, with a large human skull and green onions spread out with other objects on a table. This print is an incredible example of Picasso's talent in abstracting everyday objects into new and unrecognizable shapes. The still life has been a staple in traditional painting since the Renaissance, when it first became popular, and many artists tackle the subject during their career.",

      "Paul Jenkins Untitled, 1972 is a powerful and energetic piece with a smooth surface created by the fusion of the paints. Using a limited color palette, a large splash of brilliant red generously covers most of the pictorial plane, dominating the limited color palette. An artistic extension of green and yellow paint elegantly blend together and transcend from the highest point of red and continue to the bottom edge. Within the extension is composed of varying drips of paint which appear to have dripped downwards in the opposite direction in which the piece hangs creating a sense of wonderment.",

    description:
      "Georges Braque Page 63 from Si je mourais la-bas, 1962, captures the heart of many with its poignant and inspiring shade of cobalt blue. Rendered on crisp white paper, Braque depicts this atypical shape made up of edges, lines, and curvaceous forms. The greatest part to this aesthetically simple piece is the fragmentation of these shapes in which creates in us a peculiar reaction. The electric blue geometric shapes reconstruct along the flat white surface where the edges jut out in an upwards motion that suggests mightiness and courage.",

      "Karel Appel La Vierge Noire (The Black Virgin), c. 1975 greets us in a colorful interpretation of an anthropomorphic figure. With wild facial features such a human-like nose, eyes, and ears, this work demands attention while taking us into the wild imagination of Appel. Painted with bright greens, blues, yellows, and reds, this wooden sculpture withholds a wild energy. Waves of colors splash over each other on its body while its crimson red eyes stare in to the eyes of the beholder.",

    description:
      "Pablo Picasso Portrait stylise de Jacqueline (Tête de Femme) (Stylized portrait of Jacqueline (Head of a Woman)), 1962 is a vibrant linocut featuring warm golden yellows set against stark black. The work is one of many portraits Picasso created of his second wife Jacqueline Roque, one of his most infamous artistic muses. This portrait is an intriguing abstracted and deconstructed composition of Jacqueline, an excellent example of Picasso's well known artistic style. Picasso makes use of negative space in this print which allows the color of the paper to come through and become part of the composition itself.",
